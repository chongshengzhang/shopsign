Note: 
You may find very few inconsecutive numbers of image IDs: they are 5028, 5116, 9283, 9292, 19154, 21044, 21045.

These 7 images are also shared; but since they contain the frontal faces of humans, you must blur them before use. 

1258+7=1265

Explanation for each line in the annotation file:  

The first 8 values in each annotation file are the coordinates of the quadrilateral bounding box for each text-line (order: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left). The 9th value (which is 0, or 1) can be ignored.  The rest values are the corresponding texts of the text-line.
